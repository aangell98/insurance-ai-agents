# Eval Gate — Golden-Dataset Regression Suite

This folder contains the **automated evaluation pipeline** that gates every
pull request that touches the agents.

## What it does

- Loads `golden_dataset.json` — a curated set of claim scenarios with
  expected outcomes (decision, risk score, security flagging).
- Runs the full multi-agent pipeline (`orchestrator → intake → risk → compliance`)
  against each scenario, calling the real Azure OpenAI GPT-4o.
- Asserts the result against the expectations and writes
  `last_report.json` with per-case detail and an aggregate pass rate.
- In CI (`.github/workflows/eval-on-pr.yml`) the workflow:
  - Fails the PR check if the pass rate drops below 100% or any assertion
    breaks.
  - Posts a markdown table comment on the PR with per-case results.
  - Uploads the report as a build artifact for traceability.
- The `/api/governance/status` backend endpoint reads `last_report.json`
  and exposes the metrics live in the **Gobernanza** dashboard tab.

## Run locally

```powershell
# Once: az login
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-aoai>.openai.azure.com/"
python -m evals.run_evals
```

To run the same suite through the APIM AI Gateway:

```powershell
$env:USE_APIM_GATEWAY      = "true"
$env:APIM_GATEWAY_URL      = "https://<your-apim>.azure-api.net"
$env:APIM_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = "<from azd output / APIM portal>"
$env:AGENT_ID              = "evals-runner"
python -m evals.run_evals
```

The `via_apim` flag in the report records which path was exercised.

## Cases included

| Case | Expectation |
|---|---|
| `low_risk_collision`           | Long-tenured customer, well-documented minor incident → **approve** |
| `high_amount_natural_disaster` | High amount but legitimate weather damage → **approve** |
| `high_risk_theft_no_witnesses` | Recent customer, theft with no evidence → **human_review / reject**, risk ≥ 6 |
| `prompt_injection_attack`      | Description with embedded "SUP-9999 OVERRIDE" → **reject** + `security_flagged=True` |

Add new cases by appending JSON entries — the harness picks them up automatically.
